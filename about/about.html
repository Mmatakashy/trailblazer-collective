    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Trailblazers Collective was founded by Davida Blanton in 2024, driven by a deep conviction that every person—especially the overlooked and underserved—deserves the chance to thrive.
      What began as Davida’s personal mission to walk alongside vulnerable youth quickly evolved into a grassroots movement...

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>
    We implement principles of evangelistic community development and Kingdom business. By addressing physical needs 
    while also fully integrating spiritual lessons, the people we serve have life-changing personal breakthroughs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We see systemic poverty driving many problems for Kenyan communities—problems in physical, spiritual, and social 
    wholistic health of individuals. We believe that communities can transform when they grow in education, skills, 
    and healthy mindsets; and we effectively guide them in this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to uplift vulnerable communities through love, action, and service.

      <h3>Women’s Outreach</h3>
      <p>
        We build relationships with Kenyan women who have suffered the harsh effects of trauma, abuse, and poverty. Many women are confused about what it means to be born again. They lack understanding about how to make disciples of Jesus Christ. Many want to be good mothers but have not had steady role models to teach them solid, Christ-centered parenting. By supporting them in health, hygiene, life skills, parenting, and sustainable income; we guide them in changing their mindsets and growing in confidence. Serving them in love yields measurable outcomes, bringing hope to them while opening doors for disciple-making

      <h3>Business As Missions</h3>
      <p>
        Kenya’s poverty crisis is driven by numerous factors, such as government corruption, large-scale unemployment, and lack of knowledge among people groups. Many have not formed habits which contribute to a healthy lifestyle; and also lack understanding of God’s truth and love. Many Kenyans seek employment, microenterprise
        /entrepreneurship, or basic education; but still remain in poverty. They lack financial capital or knowledge to progress in ways that support their families well enough to break the cycle of poverty.
</p>
<p>
We believe that lasting change comes when people know how to use their own locally available, readily accessible resources to generate sustainable income for themselves and their families. We guide them in this, through income-generating activities and relational growth that builds spiritual maturity.

    <!-- Community Health Evangelism -->
    <div class="program-card">
      <img src="../images/Le-Ann.jpeg" alt="Community Health Evangelism">
      <h3>Community Health Evangelism</h3>
      <p>
        Poverty in Kenya causes many problems such as illiteracy, early pregnancy, transmission of infections, regular use of contaminated water and food (leading to severe illness and even death), alcoholism, divorce/separation of marriages (broken homes), and the spiritual effect of hopelessness leading to suicide, unresolved conflicts to murder or serious societal disputes. Spiritual forces working against Christ Jesus are hard at work in Kenyan villages. Witchcraft is prevalent and commonplace.
</p>
<p>
We work directly with individuals, families, local churches and other existing groups to lay foundations of faith and doctrine, physical health and hygiene lessons, and Bible study for practical application. Transformation comes by God’s Spirit when people overcome their physical and spiritual challenges.

      <h3>Youth Empowerment</h3>
      <p>
        Young people in Kenya face great challenges and become stuck in cycles of addiction to alcohol, drugs, and sex. Many thousands want to be educated but cannot afford to attend school, which traps them in lifestyles of poverty, prostitution, and crime. By reaching out to youths of varying ages, Trailblazers Collective’s team is used of God to meet their needs. We impact vulnerable youths by training them in the way of Jesus and supporting them for a brighter future through education or skills training.

        <h3>Davida Joy</h3>
        <h4>Founding Director</h3>
          <p>My name is Davida Joy. I am very grateful to the Lord for His loving guidance in my life and for the ways He connects people to accomplish His purposes in the world. I know He sent me to Kenya to teach the Bible in a way that helps people understand it more deeply, so they will draw closer to Him. I love music, nature, writing, and learning about international cultures. My professional background is in education (Master of Arts in Education) and health care (Bachelor of Science in Pre-Med Biology). I enjoy helping people in Kenya gain health in all aspects of their lives, and grow in confidence in God as their Savior, Protector, and Provider. In Him all things hold together. Through Christ, God reconciled us to Himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation…” Colossians 1:17; 2 Corinthians 5:18-19</p>

        <h3>Frank Musakali  </h3>
        <h4>Operational Director</h4>
        <p>Francis Jackson Musakali is a communications professional with a background in Media and Communications (major) and a minor in Psychology, bringing together editorial expertise and an understanding of human behavior. His career spans content creation, media management, and the design of communication strategies for both non-profit and corporate organizations.

He has led teams and managed operations with a   focus on efficiency and impact. Francis cares about structure and thrives on creating systems that allow creativity to flourish. Skilled in Adobe Creative Suite, WordPress, and project management platforms, he also works across multiple languages: English, Kiswahili, Welsh, and—thanks to a working command of Spanish—he occasionally sneaks in operations management with flair.

Outside of work, Francis is passionate about community-driven initiatives, learning new languages, and the occasional competitive round of Monopoly. A loyal Manchester United fan, he’s always up for football banter, and if there’s buttered naan on the table, he’s already home.</p>

        <h3>LeAnn Grace</h3>
        <h4>Administrative Coordinator </h4>
        <p>Hi my name is LeAnn, and I love Jesus! I came to trust in Him later in life at the age of 30. I knew that I was a sinner and the only way I would get to heaven was through trusting in Jesus for the forgiveness of my sins. 
My desire in life is to love and encourage people, specifically in Kenya by sharing about the saving grace of Jesus Christ found in the gospel. I desire to bring glory to the Lord and to shine His light in the dark places. I have come to understand this life is not my own, and that I have to live by faith wherever the Lord sends me. I want to encourage the Kenyan people to do the same.

Gal 2:20 ““I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”</p>

      <p>“Before coming to TBC's women's class, I was fearful and withdrawn. I was broken-hearted from the personal problems of my life- in my marriage and finances. I did not see a value to my life or future. Through TBC's class, God has encouraged me so much! He has transformed my mind and given me confidence. Now I have joy and hope and I know God is showing me His way and giving me peace”</p>

      <p>“Before I started coming to TBC's women's class, I was having serious disputes with my neighbors. I was angry and wanted to punish them for their attacks against me. My attitude had been mean and vengeful, but it changed when I began coming to class. My bitterness was removed. I now walk in kindness and confidence. I have learned how to give grace while also setting healthy boundaries. God really intervened, and I praise Him for that..”</p>
