    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Trailblazers Collective was founded by Davida Blanton in 2024, driven by a deep conviction that every person—especially the overlooked and underserved—deserves the chance to thrive.
      What began as Davida’s personal mission to walk alongside vulnerable youth quickly evolved into a grassroots movement...
    </p>
    <h2>What We Do </h2>
    <p>
     We implement principles of evangelistic community development and Kingdom business. By addressing physical needs while also fully integrating spiritual lessons, the people we serve have life-changing personal breakthroughs.
</p><p>
We see systemic poverty driving many problems for Kenyan communities- problems in physical, spiritual, and social wholistic health of individuals. We believe that communities can transform when they grow in education, skills, and healthy mindsets; and we effectively guide them in this.
    </p>

    <p>Our mission is to uplift vulnerable communities through love, action, and service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Provide education for underprivileged children</li>
      <li> Deliver food and health support to families</li>
      <li> Empower women and youth through skills programs</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Program Coordinator</p>
        <p>Francis Jackson Musakali is a communications professional with a background in Media and Communications (major) and a minor in Psychology, bringing together editorial expertise and an understanding of human behavior. His career spans content creation, media management, and the design of communication strategies for both non-profit and corporate organizations.

He has led teams and managed operations with a focus on efficiency and impact. Francis cares about structure and thrives on creating systems that allow creativity to flourish. Skilled in Adobe Creative Suite, WordPress, and project management platforms, he also works across multiple languages: English, Kiswahili, Welsh, and—thanks to a working command of Spanish—he occasionally sneaks in operations management with flair.

Outside of work, Francis is passionate about community-driven initiatives, learning new languages, and the occasional competitive round of Monopoly. A loyal Manchester United fan, he’s always up for football banter, and if there’s buttered naan on the table, he’s already home.</p>

      <p>“Before coming to TBC's women's class, I was fearful and withdrawn. I was broken-hearted from the personal problems of my life- in my marriage and finances. I did not see a value to my life or future. Through TBC's class, God has encouraged me so much! He has transformed my mind and given me confidence. Now I have joy and hope and I know God is showing me His way and giving me peace”</p>

      <p>“Before I started coming to TBC's women's class, I was having serious disputes with my neighbors. I was angry and wanted to punish them for their attacks against me. My attitude had been mean and vengeful, but it changed when I began coming to class. My bitterness was removed. I now walk in kindness and confidence. I have learned how to give grace while also setting healthy boundaries. God really intervened, and I praise Him for that..”</p>
